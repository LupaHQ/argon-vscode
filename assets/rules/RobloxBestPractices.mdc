## PRIORITY: MEDIUM

- In Roblox, clients (`.client.luau`) can't directly change a server-side (`.server.luau`) property - to change a server-side property, we need to request the server to do it. 
- In Roblox's security model, client scripts cannot directly modify server objects.
- For example, The `TakeDamage()` method in a client script sends that request to the server, but directly setting `Health = 0` from the client is blocked by Roblox's security system.
- Use clear variable naming (`PascalCase` for services, folders, modules, table keys and table functions;
    1. `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants;
    2. `camelCase` for local variables and functions).
- General script structure should go in this order: services, folders, modules, constants, and then typical variables oragnized into groups.
- Do not define Workspace as a variable, use the workspace global. Use `task.wait()`, `task.spawn()`, and `task.delay()` over `wait()`, `spawn()`, and `delay()`. 
- `task.cancel()` should be used to cancel all threads.
- Use generalized iteration (no `ipairs()` or `pairs()` is needed). 
- Do not use `WaitForChild` unless the instance is being created at runtime, or the instance is in the workspace with `StreamingEnabled` on and the code is being run on the client.
